Hi! My name is Mario and I am from Barranquilla, Colombia. I speak spanish and english fluently and I'm quite interested in coding. I like to develop websites, having the chance to work on both the front and back end sides of projects. I'm a fast learner and can easily understand new technologies based on my experience learning how to use different frameworks and libraries in less than a year. Right now I'm improving my Frontend skills and looking forward to get on a new project. If you want to reach out to me just dm me. Hope you like what I have to offer on my GitHub profile.
